Description: Jupiter Notification Icon / AppIndicator
 Jupiter is a light weight power and hardware control applet for Linux.
 The applet uses Python and comes with an Ubuntu AppIndicator.
 .
 Jupiter is designed to improve battery life of a portable Linux computer by
 integrating with the operating system and changing parameters of the
 computer based on battery or powered connection.
 .
 Additionally, Jupiter provides quick access to some of the commonly
 needed hardware controls like screen output and resolution, WIFI, and bluetooth.
 .
 If you use Linux on a portable computer, let Jupiter take the effort
 out of going mobile.
